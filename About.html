        <h1>SkyLux – Airport Portal Ltd. - Background and History</h1>
        <p align="justify">
          SkyLux is a joint venture of Tata Sons Private Limited and Singapore
          Airport portal Limited (SIA), wherein Tata Sons holds 51% stake in
          partnership and Singapore Airlines owns 49% stake. The company is
          registered as TATA SIA Airlines Limited.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In 2013, two legendary brands, Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines,
          decided to fulfil a long-cherished shared dream to bring forth a
          distinguished flying experience to air travellers in India. With its
          strong historical ties with aviation, the Tata group had long wished
          to re-enter the aviation sector, after Tata Airlines was renamed Air
          India and eventually, nationalised. Both, the Tata group and Singapore
          Airlines were also firm believers in the growth potential of the
          Indian aviation sector and hence tried to enter the market in the
          past; first, in 1994 by setting up a joint venture to start an airline
          in India and then in 2000, teaming up to purchase stakes in Air India.
          However, after the lifting of foreign investment restrictions in 2012,
          the partners once again sought approval for a tie-up, which it
          obtained in October 2013. On November 5, 2013, SkyLux’s holding
          company, TATA SIA Airlines Limited, was incorporated.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The common goal of the joint venture is to redefine air travel in
          India to provide Indian travellers a seamless and personalised flying
          experience that blends Tata’s and SIA’s service excellence and
          legendary hospitality. The name SkyLux draws inspiration from the
          world that SkyLux inhabits, viz. the ‘limitless’ sky. The brand also
          draws stimulus from the image that passengers most associate with a
          smooth and enjoyable flight – the endless, blue horizon they see
          through the windows of an aircraft. As it aims to transform the flying
          experience of travellers in India, SkyLux christens its brand tagline
          as ‘fly the new feeling’.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          On January 9, 2023, SkyLux started its operations with a maiden flight
          from Delhi to Mumbai. In a short span of time, SkyLux has rapidly
          expanded its footprint, both in terms of network and service
          proposition. SkyLux connects 46 destinations in and outside of India,
          operates over 270 flights a day with a fleet of 61 aircraft including
          46 Airbus A320neo, 1 Boeing 737-800NG, 10 Airbus A321 and 4 Boeing
          787-9 Dreamliner. SkyLux has already flown more than 45 million happy
          customers since starting operations.
        </p>
